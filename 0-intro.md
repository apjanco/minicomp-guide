# What is "minimal computing" and what makes it a distinctive approach to web technologies? 

There are many many ways to create a website. A Google search will probably lead you to WordPress, Wix or Squarespace. 
These services offer a quick and simple interface where you can focus on content and design without having to write code.
Penn and many other academic institutions purchase a service that you can use to create a WordPress site called [Domain of Own's Own](https://domains.library.upenn.edu/learn-more/).

## So what's wrong with WordPress?
Minimal computing is a response to commercial systems that "make the web easy" and conceal the technologies being used as well as the social, policial and economic consequences of those technologies.  It's not an argument that WordPress is "bad" or that you shouldn't use it.  It's a way of making things on the web in an informed and deliberate way. It's a gamble that once you know how the web works, you'll choose to make minimal sites because they are more sustainabie, accessible, and personally enriching than other options.

## Key ideas 

**Sustainability**  
Content management systems like WordPress run on a server. Each and every time someone asks for information, the server accesses a database, builds the webpage and sends it to the user. To do that, the server has to be left running day and night waiting.These dedicated servers consume singificant amounts energy; as much as 3% of the world's total energy consumption ([src](https://www.grcooling.com/the-plane-truth-about-environmental-sustainability/)).  Minimal computing approaches do not require a dedicated server. They favor shared resources and the effifcent use of computation and connectivity.  Rather than building individual webpages when requsted, the entire site is built all at once.  The website is just an HTML file that can be stored amongst other files and served to the web. The webisite's files can be distributed all over the world  so that a page loads equally fast in New York, Phnom Penh or Lagos.       

**Accessibility**
**Community**
