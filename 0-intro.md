# What is "minimal computing" and what makes it a distinct approach to web technologies? 

There are many many ways to create a website. A Google search will probably lead you to WordPress, Wix or Squarespace. 
These services offer a quick and simple interface where you can focus on content and design without having to write code.
Penn and many other academic institutions purchase a service that you can use to create a WordPress site called [Domain of Own's Own](https://domains.library.upenn.edu/learn-more/).

## So what's wrong with WordPress?
Minimal computing is a response to commercial systems that "make the web easy" and conceal the technologies being used as well as the social, policial and economic consequences of those technologies.  It's not an argument that WordPress is "bad" or that you shouldn't use it.  It's a way of making things on the web in an informed and deliberate way. It's a gamble that once you know how the web works, you'll choose to make minimal sites because they are more sustainabie, accessible, and personally enriching than other options.

## Key ideas 

**Sustainability**  
Content management systems like WordPress run on a server. Each and every time someone asks for information, the server accesses a database, builds the webpage and sends it to the user. To do that, the server has to be left running day and night waiting.These dedicated servers consume singificant amounts energy; as much as 3% of the world's total energy consumption or the equvalent emitions of the entire airline industry ([src](https://www.grcooling.com/the-plane-truth-about-environmental-sustainability/)).  Minimal computing approaches do not require a dedicated server. They favor shared resources and the effifcent use of computation and connectivity. The website is just an HTML file that can be stored amongst other files and served to the web. The webisite's files can be distributed all over the world so that a page loads equally fast in New York, Phnom Penh or Lagos.  

**Accessibility**  
If you're making a webiste, you probably have some kind of picture in your mind of how people will use it. People will visit your site to learn, or share stories, or have fun. The first user that we imagive is always ourself. That's normal. But many many kinds of people will interact with your site who are not like you.  How can we be sure that they have the same kinds of experiences? Minimal computing is higly global in its approach to accessibility.  It is concerned not only with the needs of users with limited vision, differing cultural and religous views 

designing a website, it is important that people be able to     Can the site be naviagted using a screen reader.  Is also address a global audience.   PH guide for writing. 
What does accessibilty mean? no presumption of devices and connectivity of any single region of the global.  Participation of global users. 

**Community**


What it is and reasons to do it
