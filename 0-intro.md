# Making things minimal

There are many, many ways to create a website. A Google search will probably lead you to WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace. 
These services offer a quick and simple interface where you can focus on content and design without writing any code.
Penn and many other academic institutions purchase a service that you can use to create a WordPress site called [Domain of Own's Own](https://domains.library.upenn.edu/learn-more/).

## So what's wrong with WordPress or Wix?
Minimal computing is a response to commercial systems that "make the web easy" by concealing the technologies being used and the social, political, and economic consequences of those technologies. It's not an argument that WordPress is "bad" or that you shouldn't use it. It's a way of making things on the web in an informed and deliberate manner. It's a gamble that once you know how the web works, you'll choose to make minimal sites because they are more sustainable, accessible, and personally enriching than other options.

## Key ideas 

**Sustainability**  
Content management systems like WordPress run on a server. Each and every time someone asks for information, the server accesses a database, builds the page, and sends it back to the user. To do that, the server has to be left running day and night waiting for requests.These dedicated servers consume significant amounts energy, as much as 3% of the world's total energy consumption. That is equivalent to the emissions of the entire airline industry ([src](https://www.grcooling.com/the-plane-truth-about-environmental-sustainability/)). Minimal computing approaches do not require a dedicated server. They favor shared resources and the efficient use of computation and connectivity. Your website might just be an HTML file that can be stored amongst other files in a shared space and served to the web. The website's files can be distributed worldwide so that a page loads equally fast in New York, Phnom Penh, or Lagos.  

**Accessibility**  
If you're making a website, you probably have some picture in your mind of how people will use it. People will visit your site to learn, share stories, or have fun. The first user that we have in mind is always ourselves. That's normal. But many, many kinds of people will interact with your site who are not like you. How can we be sure that they'll have the types of experiences you intend? Minimal computing is highly global in its approach to accessibility. Can users navigate your site using a phone or screen reader? If you add images or videos to your site, will that increase the user's cost of loading the page? Could your site be shared on a thumb drive in areas without internet access? As you write content, consider terms that might seem self-evident to you but not to a global audience ([more](https://programminghistorian.org/en/author-guidelines#write-for-a-global-audience)). Making minimal sites offers an opportunity to consider how own experiences with web technologies inform assumptions that often pose barriers to access and communication.  

**Community**
