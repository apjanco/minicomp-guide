# What is "minimal computing" and what makes it a distinctive approach to web technologies? 

There are many many ways to create a website. A Google search will probably lead you to WordPress, Wix or Squarespace. 
These services offer a quick and simple interface where you can focus on content and design without having to write code.
Penn and many other academic institutions purchase a service that you can use to create a WordPress site called ([Domain of Own's Own](https://domains.library.upenn.edu/learn-more/).

## So what's wrong with WordPress?
Minimal computing is a response to commercial systems that "make the web easy" and conceal the technologies being used as well as the social, policial and economic consequences of those technologies.  It's not an argument that WordPress is "bad" or that you shouldn't use it.  It's a way of making things on the web in an informed and deliberate way. It's a gamble that once you know how the web works, you'll choose to make minimal sites because they are more sustainabie, accessible, and personally enriching than other options.

## Key ideas 

**Sustainability** 
Content management systems like WordPress run on a server. Each and every time someone asks for information, it accesses a database, builds the webpage and sends it to the user. The server is on day and night waiting for requests. Running these computers all the time consumes singificant amounts energy; as much as 3% of total energy consumption.  While providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure work to be efficient and offset their consumption, the carbon emissions needed to generate this much electricity is comparable to the airline industy.      

**Accessibility**
**Community**


What it is and reasons to do it
- enviornmental impact of datacenters, comparison to airline industry 
- accessibility in areas with limited connectivity and access to processing
- open-source, free-tier infrastructure, portable between systems
