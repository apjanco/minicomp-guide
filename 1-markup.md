There are two common ways to create a minimal webpage.  The simplest is to use hypertext markup or [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML). Markup uses a system of tags to add information to plain text. For example, to make some text bold, you'd add an opening `<b>` tag followed by a closing `</b>` tag.  The tags indicate where the markup begins and ends: `<b>I am bold</b> I am not bold`. In recent years, [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) has become a convenient way to compose text for the web. For the example above, we'd write: `**I am bold** I am not bold`. A script is used to convert the markdown to HTML, so it's entirely a matter of the author's preference.  

In this section, we with publish some simple content on the web using markup and markdown. Both methods will require a free GitHub account. Please go to this page and create an account: https://education.github.com/students
