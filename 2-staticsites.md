# Static site builders 

In this section, we'll discuss common programs that you can use to build static websites.  You can always write your own content in HTML, but static site generators offer a good way of automating the repetitive parts.  This is especially useful when your site has more than one page. For example, your site probably needs a navigation bar.  We could copy and paste the same code into each and everypage.  But if we make a change, then we'll have to go back through eavh and every page to make the change over and over.  That's not a good use of your time.
